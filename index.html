          <h2 class="story-header">Early Coding</h2>
          <p>As far back as I can remember I've been a passionate creator, problem solver and learner of new skills. </p>
            <p>
            Like many school age children I was passionate about video games, and my first experience with HTML was creating a fan site for my favorite game at the time. Another one of my games had a level editor and I remember spending hours designing maps on paper and reverse-engineering the programming interface through tutorial maps.

          <h2 class="story-header">Music And Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>At fifteen I developed a passion for guitar, and this led me to writing songs, earning a music degree, teaching professionally, and starting my own business with many contract teachers under my banner.</p>
          <p>As a musician I developed a growth mindset, and to always be learning. I learned firsthand that I cannot master a piece of music in one all-night practice session, but that I can reshape my brain and finger dexterity with daily practice. As a coder, this mindset drives me to code every day. </p>

          <h2 class="story-header">Rediscovering Code</h2>
          <p>Although my business has been successful, I grew restless to develop hard skills. Browsing through a local bookstore I found myself in the tech section, looking at manuals for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My early experience with HTML and styles led me to wonder "What is JavaScript?" I quickly got hooked, learning as much as I could with free online resources. </p>
          <p>
            I used as much free time as I could toiling away learning how to code on my own.

          <h2 class="story-header">Taking the Plunge</h2>
          <p>One day, my wife and I decided to find a new home for our dog Sadie, who had many special needs. It was a difficult and painful decision, that lead to some emotional moments. My wife wanted me to be happy and asked me: "What would make you happy?" </p>
          <p>
            Being asked this question provided clarity. I said: "I really want to enroll in a coding bootcamp and launch a new career in coding." I knew this decision may be risky would require her full support. </p>

          <h2 class="story-header">A New Beginning</h2>
          <p>Since starting and completing Austin Coding Academy, my passion for coding has only grown. I especially like diving deep into javascript datastructures and algorithms.</p>
            
            <p>
            I would be excited to work with a collaborative team to create exceptional user experience, solve problems and learn new skills along the way!
